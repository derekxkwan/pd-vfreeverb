# pd-vfreeverb
minor cleanup of Katja Vetter's Pd-vanilla freeverb abstraction


original Pd-vanilla abstraction done by Katja Vetter in May 2012. For my own use, I've done some minor cleanup including:

- increasing the font size
- minimize number of inlets
- getting rid of debugging number boxes
- adding a "clear" method to clear all delay lines
